STORE STRUCTURE FOR gamestagram

session.user: {
    email:
    username:
}

//when entering a /user/<int> -> get info using useeffect?
//do i save posts table elements here? with caption, url in store? which then has a .likes to store all the posts likes.
//Is that too much data in store? Do I need this much?
profile.user: {
    username: blah_username
    followers:{
        <list of int of userid> //sorted by create date?
    }
    followings:{
        <list of int of userid> //sorted by create date?
    }
}

//when entering / (main page)
dashboard.posts: {
    <list of int from followings id where session.user = user_id : {
        <list of int from likes id where post_id = corresponding>
    }> //sorted by create date limit 30? how to limit posts or render more on bottom of page?
}

//On your dashboard you want a store that contains a list of all of the people you follow (followings table where )



//NOTE followings table - user_id is the id of the user that is "famous" (easier to put it this way) and follower_id is the person that wants to follow
//To see all of a certain person's followers- find all rows where user_id = famous persons user_id.


//when clicking on a post you are directed to the /posts/<int post_id>
post.info: {
    comments:<comments related to post_id>
    likes:<likes related to post_id?> //do I store this- probably yeah?
}
